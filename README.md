# BallTracking
You need to install https://github.com/mu-opensource/MuVisionSensor3 as a zip library in Arduino IDE.
Set the four dial switches on the camera as **v ^ v v** (the second switch dialed up to I2C) and connect the camera module to the I2C grove on NyBoard.
The battery should be turned on to drive the servos. 

The tracking demo works with a yellow tennis ball.
